# PNEUMONIA-DETECTION-MODEL
Pneumonia Detection Model using X-ray Images
Description
This repository contains a deep learning model trained to distinguish between normal human lungs and those affected by pneumonia. It is tailored to use X-ray images sourced from radiography labs, but is robust enough to analyze images from the internet or custom uploads from users.

Features
High Accuracy: The model has been trained with extensive datasets, ensuring high precision and recall rates.
Versatility: Accepts X-ray images from various sources including direct uploads from users.
User-Friendly Interface: Easily upload an X-ray image and receive an instantaneous diagnosis.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (>=3.6) installed.
Required Python libraries: TensorFlow (or PyTorch), Flask, PIL, etc. (Check requirements.txt for a complete list.)

#Installation
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required packages:


Copy code
cd pneumonia-detection-model
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Start the web application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Use the upload button to submit an X-ray image of the lungs.

The system will process the image and display whether the X-ray indicates pneumonia or not.

Data
The model was trained using X-ray images from radiography labs. While this ensures a high degree of accuracy for images from similar sources, the model has also been tested and optimized for general X-ray images found online or from personal users.
